I have over 7 years of experience in software development. Most projects I’ve performed are **Java** based and fewer amounts are **Groovy**, **Ruby**, and **JavaScript** projects. Most Java projects were implemented on top of Spring stack. 

I’ve been working on project leading positions for 5 years managing small (3 members) and mid-size (20 members) teams. 

Also, I have experience as a trainer and mentor. I love TDD and hate dogmas. I prefer pragmatic development approaches and trying to apply the next motto “Right tool for the job” where it’s possible. I don’t believe in Scrum as a “silver bullet”, but must admit it’s very effective framework for managing software development.


I’m a co-founder of a local user group [IT Booze](http://www.itbooze.com.ua).
