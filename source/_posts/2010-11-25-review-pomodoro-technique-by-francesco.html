Some time ago I read this book <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/products.html#pomodoropdf">"The Pomodoro Technique" by Francesco Cirillo</a><br /><span id="bxgy_x_title"><span class="bxgy-binding-byline"><span class="bxgy-byline-text">I have to say that it's really useful and super fast introduction for this particular time management technique. I highly recommend it for everybody interested in Pomodoro.</span></span></span><br /><span id="bxgy_x_title"><span class="bxgy-binding-byline"><span class="bxgy-byline-text">I don't want to analyze main chapters because you just have to read them all.</span></span></span><br /><span id="bxgy_x_title"><span class="bxgy-binding-byline"><span class="bxgy-byline-text">Of cause you read only about basic approaches and you have to adapt some of them. It's general practice. There is no single way to do the job, there is only recommended way to organize you work time. You have to start applying Pomodoro iteratively and make correction to "your" technique after each working day.</span></span></span><br /><br /><span id="bxgy_x_title"><span class="bxgy-binding-byline"><span class="bxgy-byline-text">Have fun with Pomodoro. </span></span></span>
