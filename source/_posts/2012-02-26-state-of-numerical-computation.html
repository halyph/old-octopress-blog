When I was a student I spent a huge amount of time doing difference numerical computation with MATLAB and Maple. I must say I was falling in love with MATLAB. This environment, language and visualization possibilities were amazing and very powerful. I simply couldn't choose another stuff. It gave me a chance fully concentrate on engineering problems I had been trying to solve.<br /><br />But now I must admit that MATLAB is very expensive software. And we should look around for other open-source mathematical computation environments. Today I'm biased because I prefer to invest time in general purpose language then in specialized computation languages (like MATLAB, R).<br /><br />I've found very interested comparison (<a href="http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/">Mathesaurus</a>): <br /><div id="__ss_11756513" style="width: 477px;"><b style="display: block; margin: 12px 0 4px;"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/halyph/math-synonyms" target="_blank" title="Math synonyms">Math synonyms</a></b> <iframe frameborder="0" height="510" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/11756513" width="477"></iframe> <br /><div style="padding: 5px 0 12px;">View more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/" target="_blank">documents</a> from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/halyph" target="_blank">Orest Ivasiv</a> </div></div><br />Also, <a href="http://hyperpolyglot.org/">Hyperpolyglot</a> provides nice comparison <a href="http://hyperpolyglot.org/numerical-analysis">"Numerical Analysis Software: Fortran, MATLAB, R, NumPy"</a>.<br /><br />Based on these two comparisons I've selected several factors for choosing the "right" numerical environments:<br /><ol><li>Commercial or open-source</li><li>Visualization possibilities</li><li>Language itself (MATLAB, Maple, R, etc.): computational specific or general purpose (Python, Clojure/<a href="http://incanter.org/">Incanter</a>, etc. )</li><li>Integration with Fortran/C/C++ etc.</li><li>GUI features</li></ol>
