<br />Recently, a day ago :-) I visited <a href="http://rubyshift.org/">RubyShift</a> 2012 conference (September 29—30, 2012, Kiev, Ukraine). It's primary a Ruby conference with additional mixing from related technologies.
<br />
<br />I'm a seasonal Ruby developer and Java is my primary programming language. So, what do I find so interesting in Ruby conference? Well, it's totally a different community with own culture, tools, frameworks and issues. It's better to break the borders and look out of the box. We might find there something interesting and amazing there.
<br />
<br />Here is a list of speeches which are favored by me:
<br />
<ol>
    <li><b>DataMapper 2 — an object mapping toolkit</b>, by <i>Piotr Solnica</i></li>Data Mapper is well-known pattern in Java community. It was breakthrough for me that Ruby/Rails community is not satisfied with ActiveRecord :-) Nice movement in "better" OO design direction.
    <li><b>RVM 2: what we have learnt and where are we going</b>, by <i>Michał Papis</i></li>I was really happy to see the guy behind this tool. The author is going to do a very important work to get rid off shell scripting and re-write RVM 2 in Ruby. I can predict that RVM 2 will be available on Windows as well.
    <li><b>RabbitMQ Hands On</b>, by <i>Alvaro Videla</i></li>Simple introduction in RabbitMQ. Nothing special (because it's quite popular in Java), but based on this talk it isn't popular in Ruby community (additional findings for myself).
    <li><b>ascii.io: No nonsense asciicasting for serious hackers</b>, by <i>Marcin Kulik</i></li>
    <blockquote class="tr_bq"><a href="http://ascii.io/">ASCII.IO</a> is the simplest way to record your terminal and share the recordings with your fellow geeks. </blockquote>Very nice tool, well done and pragmatic. The presenter shared with the audience the ideas behind, technical issues and implementation details. It was really interesting.
    <li><b>PostgreSQL in Highload Projects</b>, by <i>Alexey Vasiliev</i></li>Alexey presented us "magical" sides of PostgreSQL. I haven't known about all those powerful extension and techniques which can be used with PostgreSQL. Well done :-) </ol>
