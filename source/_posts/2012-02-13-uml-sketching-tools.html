Such tool as Visio (and similar) is doing their job well till you don't need "aggressive" redrawing ;-) Have you ever tried to draw "huge" sequence, activity diagrams in Visio? I've "<span class="example">struggled</span>" with grouping, layouting, styling, etc. So, I have decided to concentrate more on modelling and switched to "easy-going" UML tools also knowing as <b>"Textual UML tools".</b><br />Here is the list of my favorite:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/">PlantUML</a> - very powerful tool. It supports very intuitive diagram language. Seven diagram types, nice styling. And very good documentation.</li><li><a href="http://www.umlet.com/">UMLet</a> - It's true sketching tool. Very very simple. And you shouldn't expect sexy UI ;-) BUT! It's so "right tool for the job". You just have to try it.</li><li><a href="http://www.umlgraph.org/">UMLGraph</a> - It can be used to generate UML class and sequence diagrams. It has nice integration with javadocs tool.</li></ul>I think that this <a href="http://www.holub.com/goodies/uml/">Allen Holub's UML Quick Reference</a> (example based and very pragmatic) might be helpful.
