I think it's very important question. Because studding some new technology requires some time (and maybe money).<br /><br />So, I've created for myself brief checklist which helps me to make this non-easy decision.<br /><ol><li>How long it will take for me to master the major approaches of selected technology?</li><li>Can I reuse the gained knowledge during my daily development work?</li><li>How long it will take to train/coach my team mates to use this technology?</li><li>How big is the market for the selected technology?</li><li>How big is the local community for the selected technology?</li><li>How easily can we hire new developers with appropriate knowledge in selected technology?</li><li>Will it be profitable to have the knowledge in that technology?</li></ol><br />I know&nbsp; that some items are very boring&nbsp; and mercantile, but it's life, real life. And we should align our priorities appropriately.
