It's very convenience if you need some sort of review in scope of this subject.<br /><br />I believe that any Rails developer which think that Java/JVM is enemy camp should read it. The tools which are highlighted in this book are very interesting and provide for Ruby/Rails developers broader space.<br /><br />As for Java developers it's a good start point for integration Rails in corporate Java environment. The reader get all required info to get started.<br /><br />Here is a list of tools:<br /><ul><li>Warbler (<a href="https://github.com/jruby/warbler">https://github.com/jruby/warbler</a>) - Warbler provides a minimal, flexible, Ruby-like way to bundle up all of your application files for deployment to a Java environment</li><li>Trinidad (<a href="https://github.com/trinidad/trinidad">https://github.com/trinidad/trinidad</a>) - Trinidad allows you to run Rails or Rack applications within an embedded  Apache Tomcat container. </li><li>Kirk (<a href="https://github.com/strobecorp/kirk">https://github.com/strobecorp/kirk</a>) - Kirk is a wrapper around Jetty that hides all of the insanity and wraps your Rack application in a loving embrace</li><li>Torquebox (<a href="http://torquebox.org/">http://torquebox.org</a>) - TorqueBox is a new kind of <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> application                   platform that supports popular                   technologies such as <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and                   <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>, while extending                   the footprint of Ruby                   applications to include built-in support for services such as messaging,                   scheduling, caching, and daemons.</li><li>jetpack (<a href="https://github.com/square/jetpack">https://github.com/square/jetpack</a>), it wasn't mentioned in book. It packages your JRuby webapp for Jetty.</li></ul>I must admit that the most impressive is Torquebox. It's very powerful and it uses all power of JBoss App Server:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">TorqueBox provides an all-in-one environment, built upon the latest                   <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/">JBoss AS</a> Java application server and                   <a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</a>.&nbsp; </blockquote>Such features as messaging, long running jobs, scheduled jobs are provided out of the box, have nice API which easy to use. Have a try.
