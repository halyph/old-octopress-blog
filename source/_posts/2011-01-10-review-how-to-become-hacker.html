<br />
<br />It's worth reading. I think that it's like hacker "mantra" ;-) I don't want to retell all that stuff. Just want to sum up.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-size: large;">1. Programming language learning. </span>
<br />We should learn different programming languages from paradigm point of view: "classical" OOP languages (C++, C#, Java), procedural languages (C), functional languages (Lisp family languages: Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure), dynamic and scripting languages (Perl, Python, Ruby) and web-related (JavaScript).
<br />
<blockquote><i>"Besides being the most important ... languages, they represent very different approaches to programming, and each will educate you in valuable ways."</i></blockquote>It means that you should&nbsp; learn languages from different paradigms to get some conceptual&nbsp; knowledge.
<br /><i>E.g. </i>You shouldn't learn Java and&nbsp; C#, or Python and Ruby. I think it's just waste of your time.
<br />
<blockquote><b><i>"To be a real hacker, you need to get to the point where you can learn a new language in days by relating what's in the manual to what you already know.This means you should learn several very different languages."</i></b></blockquote><span style="font-size: large;">2. Learn Unix/Linux.</span>
<br /><span style="font-size: small;">I think the best way to learn is to start playing with Ubuntu.</span>
<br />
<br /><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: large;">3. Learn English and native language.&nbsp;</span> </span>
<br /><span style="font-size: small;">You should be able the speak and write </span>fluently in both.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-size: large;">4. Persistent learning </span>
<br /><span style="font-size: small;">It's the key point to success in any profession.</span>
<br />
<br />
<br /><span style="font-size: large;">Summary</span>
<br />
<blockquote><i>"To follow the path:</i>
    <br /><i>look to the master,</i>
    <br /><i>follow the master,</i>
    <br /><i>walk with the master,</i>
    <br /><i>see through the master,</i>
    <br /><i>become the master."</i></blockquote>
