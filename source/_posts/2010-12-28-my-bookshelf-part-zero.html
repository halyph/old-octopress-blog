I have several reading directions and special sequence of&nbsp; reading. I think it would be interesting to share my virtual bookshelf: books which I've read and books which I'm going to read.<br /><br /><b>Here are books' categories:</b><br /><ul><li>Design, Patterns, Refactoring and Architecture</li><li>Agile Technique</li><li>Tools</li><li>Learning and Career Development</li><li>Java and JVM Languages</li><li> Other</li></ul>I'm sure I will extend this list, but this one is OK as start point.<br /><br />Maybe it will be good to group books by authors as well. Will see. Definitely, I have to try this approach as well.<br /><br />In the next part I'm going to post about <i>"Design, Patterns, Refactoring and Architecture"</i> bookshelf.
