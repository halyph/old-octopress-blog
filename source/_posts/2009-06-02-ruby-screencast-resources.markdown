As you know there are several way to kick-off and learn a new programming language, environment or special tools:

* tutorial
* screencast

But, now screencast is more popular for effective start and feature demonstration. So, I'm trying to collect as more as possible screencast resources for learning Ruby and Rails.

*   [http://railscasts.com](http://railscasts.com/), it's the most popular free Rails screencasts
*   [http://sdruby.com](http://sdruby.com/), it's San Diego's Ruby community, there are about 59 Ruby and Rails screencasts
*   [http://www.rubyplus.org/episodes](http://www.rubyplus.org/episodes), Free Ruby and Rails Screencast, about 93 episodes
*   [http://www.tekniqal.com](http://www.tekniqal.com/), there are 17 tutorials covering basic Ruby topics
*   [http://www.confreaks.com/events](http://www.confreaks.com/events), here is located videos from several Ruby conferences
*   [http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/ruby](http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/ruby) and [http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/rubyonrails](http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/rubyonrails), it's great resource for learning from ground up. There are a lot of interesting videos for beginners. Also, this resource includes other areas, not only Ruby/Rails related
*   [http://www.bestechvideos.com/tag/ruby-on-rails](http://www.bestechvideos.com/category/development/ruby) and [http://www.bestechvideos.com/category/development/ruby](http://www.bestechvideos.com/category/development/ruby), video collection from different conferences, presentations, etc.
*   [http://railslab.newrelic.com/scaling-rails](http://railslab.newrelic.com/scaling-rails) there are educational videos, teaching you just about everything you need to know to create a Rails application that can scale
*   [http://rubytu.be](http://rubytu.be/) is a community driven collection of Ruby related videos and screencasts
*   [http://www.learnivore.com](http://www.learnivore.com/) is another great screencast aggregator
*   [http://www.teachmetocode.com/screencasts](http://www.teachmetocode.com/screencasts) is similar to railscast.com but have less posts, it's worth to look into
