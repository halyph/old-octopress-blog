<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kFLV4Wc3Kl8/T5bX54e2wgI/AAAAAAAAAjE/o5eeyr60NH8/s1600/L_GettingGoodwithGit.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"></a>There are several books about Git. I've decided to review them all and started with "Getting Good with Git" by Andrew Burgess<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://rockablepress.com/books/getting-good-with-git" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"><img border="0" height="302" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kFLV4Wc3Kl8/T5bX54e2wgI/AAAAAAAAAjE/o5eeyr60NH8/s320/L_GettingGoodwithGit.png" width="202" /> </a></div>First of all it's beginner level book. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone experienced developer. Even more it's more like tutorial and not a book.<br />So, based on previous statements the next chapters can be easily cut off:<br /><ul><li>Introduction to Git</li><li>Commands</li><li>GitHub</li></ul>&nbsp;IMHO, I would left the next two chapters:<br /><ul><li>Configuration</li><li>Beyond the Basics</li></ul>And more important is the price of this book: <span class="price"><b>$19</b>. Guys, come on </span><b class="price">$19 </b><span class="price">for this. It doesn't cost this money. </span><br /><b class="price"><br /></b><span class="price">Summary: don't spend your time and money on this book.</span><b class="price"><br /></b>
