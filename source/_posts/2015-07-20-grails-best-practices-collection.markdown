Recently, I had a pleasure to look into several Grails v.2.3+ projects. Despite the fact that I'm not a Grails developer I discovered some unti-patterns. 
Then I started looking around to find some *Grails projects best practices*. And  they are well known and people still doing mistakes.
However, I found several nice resources and I'm quoting them here. I keep references back to original source, but use "copy-paste" post to have aggregated practices in single place.
