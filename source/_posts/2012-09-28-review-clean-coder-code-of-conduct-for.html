<br />This book has <i>wow </i>effect for me. The author is famous <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin" target="_blank">@unclebobmartin</a>. I called books of such type as <b><i>"craftsmanship</i></b>" books (term borrowed from <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin" target="_blank">@unclebobmartin</a>). This book is like a companion book for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/ref=pd_sim_b_3">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>, but it has a little bit another "inflection":
<br />
<ol>
    <li>Book has close relation to software engineering as a profession and style is narrative. It very easy to read and follow the general idea.</li>
    <li>Uncle Bob did very important thing (as for me), he told us about his own failures and their consequences. It is looks very honest which brings together author and reader.</li>
    <li>He isn't cardinal in his statements. Be pragmatic, borrow his experience and just don't do the same mistakes.</li>
    <li>You won't find any technological advices in this book. There is ONLY life concepts :)</li>
    <li>It's like a craftsmanship Zen for software engineers.</li>
    <li>Uncle Bob gives us bootstrap cookbook for non-technological skills.</li>
</ol>&nbsp;Read it. Re-think the ideas. And improve your skills.
