I've heard this words' pair too often and I never knew what does it mean?<br /><br />Until I read these two posts: <a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2008/02/ultra-balkanization-makes-lisp-autistic.html">Ultra-Balkanization Makes Lisp Autistic</a> and <a href="http://www.findinglisp.com/blog/2005/12/reddit-and-lisp-psychosis.html">Reddit and Lisp psychosis</a>.<br /><br />In general every Lisp developer tends to write "new" super-puper Lisp, invent the wheel, write own "cool" emacs extension and tell to the world that he is a HACKER. I love this.<br /><br />Nowadays, Clojure is the real answer for Lisp guys. It can consolidate the Lisp language flexibility and JVM power. I think it's a good choice.
