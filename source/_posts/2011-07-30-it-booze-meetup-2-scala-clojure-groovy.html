<br />Today, I had a chance to attend local user group <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/itboozeinif/home">IT Booze</a>. It was the second meetup and it was very interesting, because of topics which were under discussion: Scala, Clojure And Groovy. I love such events especially in my town. :-)
<br />
<br />I'd like to share my <i>reflections </i>regarding these cool languages.
<br />
<br />As you know these languages are very popular on JVM (of cause not so popular as Java :-). And I'm sure every passionate Java/JVM developer has been thinking "what's the <b>Next</b> <b>Big Language</b>". It's really hard to choose the next one.
<br />
<br />So, here is a short "brain snapshot":
<br />
<ol>
    <li>Scala and Clojure are great languages with huge amount of interesting features, but to master them we need to use Scala (or Clojure) on daily basis.</li>
    <li>Scala appeared as complex language. I think it requires a <span class="st">steeper learning curve then Clojure or Groovy. It means we must invest much, much more.</span></li>
    <li><span class="st">Clojure has lisp syntax, but innovative concurrency concept is worth to look into. I say <b>lisp</b>, because it might be a stopper for someone to evaluate it as a next big language.</span></li>
    <li><span class="st">Clojure and functional programming require to "patch" our way of thinking. And it can be difficult.</span></li>
    <li><span class="st">Groovy is agile language. We (Java developers) can start using it right away. I think we should invest more in Groovy just to boost our productivity in: scripting, testing, automation routine work, etc. It doesn't require big investments and we can learn as we go.</span></li>
</ol><span class="st"> So, here is outcome from this meetup:</span>
<br />
<ul>
    <li><span class="st">start using Groovy</span></li>
    <li><span class="st">look into Clojure concepts</span></li>
    <li><span class="st">postpone Scala for now</span></li>
</ul><span class="st">Could you please share your thoughts regarding this?</span>
