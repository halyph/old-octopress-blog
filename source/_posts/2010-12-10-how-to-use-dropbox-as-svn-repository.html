You probably know about such cool stuff as Dropbox. So, I use it as on-line SVN repository for my own projects. It gives me an opportunity to have my own repository everywhere. <br />Check this post before go ahead: <a href="http://mlevit.wordpress.com/2009/11/18/how-to-use-subversion-dropbox-to-create-an-effective-work-managementbackup-system/">How to use Subversion &amp; Dropbox to create an effective work  management/backup&nbsp;system</a><br /><br />So,<b> 1) you have to create SVN repository in some Dropbox folder</b>; 2) do the checkout from this folder on every work machine where you need to do something with your SVN repository. That's it.
