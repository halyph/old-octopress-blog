<div>I always had a trouble how to explain this subject to other people. That's why I've decided to collect the main definitions (and explanations) of internationalization and localization in one place.</div>
<div>
    <br /><a href="http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-i18n">W3C </a>explain this concept pretty well:
    <br />
    <blockquote class="tr_bq"><b>Internationalization </b>is the design and development of a product, application or document content that enables easy localization for target audiences that vary in culture, region, or language.&nbsp;</blockquote>
    <blockquote class="tr_bq">&nbsp;<b>Localization </b>refers to the adaptation of a product, application or document content to meet the language, cultural and other requirements of a specific target market (a locale). </blockquote>
</div>
<div>
    <br />Let's <span class="active"><span class="translation">paraphrase </span></span>these definitions based on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/Articles/InternatAndLocaliz.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000277-SW1">Apple guides</a>:
    <br />
    <ul>
        <li><b>Internationalization (i18n) </b>is the process of designing and building an application to facilitate localization. The main concern is that application can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes.</li>
        <li><b>Localization (l10n) </b>is the cultural and linguistic adaptation of an internationalized application to two or more culturally-distinct markets</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <blockquote class="tr_bq">
        <div>The primary task of localization is translating the user interface elements and documentation. Localization involves not only changing the language interaction, but also other relevant changes such as display of numbers, dates, currency, and so on. Other types of data, such as sounds and images, may require localization if they are culturally sensitive. The better internationalized an application is, the easier it is to localize it for a particular language and character encoding scheme.
