In our case it's your knowledge. Most people are very kind and really like to share own experience.</li><li><strong>Public Visibility</strong> - here you can promote yourself as passionate and well skilled developer</li><li><strong>Job Opportunities</strong> - you can find new contact which suggest a new job</li><li><strong>Find Expert</strong> - it's the right place to find the right people which might help you to solve some technical problems</li><li><strong>Become an Expert</strong> - it can happen </li><li><strong>Meet Nice People</strong> - just fact :)</li></ul><div>If you have other nice benefits please add in comments.</div>
