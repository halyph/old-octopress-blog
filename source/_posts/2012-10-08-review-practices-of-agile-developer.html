Authors (Venkat Subramaniam and Andy Hunt) shared their ideas and better practices regarding "how to become a real agile developer".<br />Each chapter has predefined structure:<br /><ol><li>General idea</li><li>Why something went wrong </li><li>Applying the practice</li><li>What might go wrong if we try to follow the practice without common sense</li><li>Summary</li></ol>I can suggest this book for any developer who has been diving in the world of "agile". Even more, any junior developer must read this book. After the reading and applying some of the recipes you've got real improvements in your daily work. Do not hesitate and start reading right away.
