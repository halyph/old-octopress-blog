<br />Relief provides a new look on Java projects. Relying on our ability to deal with real objects by examining their shape, size or relative place in space it gives a "physical" view on java packages, types and fields and their relationships, making them easier to handle. Lets discuss quickly how we interprete physical properties and how it can help us to grasp project characteristics.
<br /><a href="http://jcsc.sourceforge.net/"><span style="font-size: large;">38. JCSC</span></a>
<br />JCSC is a powerful tool to check source code against a highly definable coding standard and potential bad code. The standard covers naming conventions for class, interfaces, fields, parameter, ... . Also the structural layout of the type (class/interface) can be defined. Like where to place fields, either before or after the methods and in which order. The order can be defined through the visibility or by type (instance, class, constant). The same is applicable for methods. Each of those rules is highly customizable. Readability is enhanced by defining where to put white spaces in the code and when to use braces. The existence of correct JavaDoc can be enforced and various levels. Apart from that, it finds weaknesses in the the code -- potential bugs -- like empty catch/finally block, switch without default, throwing of type 'Exception', slow code.
<br /><a href="http://spoon.gforge.inria.fr/"><span style="font-size: large;">39. Spoon</span></a>
