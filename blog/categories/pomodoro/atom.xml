I highly recommend it for everybody interested in Pomodoro.</span></span></span><br /><span id="bxgy_x_title"><span class="bxgy-binding-byline"><span class="bxgy-byline-text">I don&rsquo;t want to analyze main chapters because you just have to read them all.</span></span></span><br /><span id="bxgy_x_title"><span class="bxgy-binding-byline"><span class="bxgy-byline-text">Of cause you read only about basic approaches and you have to adapt some of them. It&rsquo;s general practice. There is no single way to do the job, there is only recommended way to organize you work time. You have to start applying Pomodoro iteratively and make correction to &ldquo;your&rdquo; technique after each working day.</span></span></span><br /><br /><span id="bxgy_x_title"><span class="bxgy-binding-byline"><span class="bxgy-byline-text">Have fun with Pomodoro. </span></span></span></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve got a real pressure because I had to learn TOO many different things simultaneous. And I had very small time frame to do the job in time. I needed some tool which can help me to organize all my learning activities.
<br />I remembered about Pomodoro. Without any delay I started reading this book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pomodoro-Technique-Illustrated-Minutes-Pragmatic/dp/1934356506">Pomodoro Technique Illustrated: Can You Focus - Really Focus - for 25 Minutes?, by Staffan Noteber</a>

<br />

<br />
<br />In general this book opened my mind. I&rsquo;m going to try Pomodoro. The most beautiful thing it that this time management technique is very simple, has small set of rules and tools.
<br />
<br />Summary: well written book, short and pragmatic. Good start point to learn Pomodoro technique and adapt it to your own needs.</p>
