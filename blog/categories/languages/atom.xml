<p>This post is very subjective and reflect the my current point of view.</p>

<p>There are tons of different programming
languages. Few of them you are using daily, few of them from time to
time. And huge amount are touched “accidentally” (via playing and
writing “big” hello world).</p>

<p>Now the question is: Should we spend our
time playing with every hipster/hype language? Maybe it’s better to
invest own time in something really important. In something which can
improve our productivity and range of task which can be solved by our
“major” language(s).</p>

<p>In general to “learn” a new language is
not a big deal. But, nowadays we can’t use language itself in
isolation. “Learn a new language” means not only language, but also
its <strong>related areas</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>ecosystem (libraries, frameworks,
IDE, tools)</li>
<li>problems which can be solved with
this language (some languages are well suited for the particular set
of problems: Erlang, Prolog, SQL, etc.)</li>
<li>community</li>
<li>best practices and
idiomatic code</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, if you calculate and recall your
experience You will notice that language <strong>related areas</strong> take huge
amount of time to master.</p>

<p>Here is some general sample: Imagine
that language X is your major tool for making money. Now, you’ve
switched, temporary, to language Y, for reasonable amount of time
(several months). Then you switched back to language X and stick there
for long-long period of time. You will notice how you are loosing those
minimal knowledge (required to accomplish the tasks) gained for language
Y. You can recollect the syntax, but related areas of language Y
have been evolved and updated. Even more, some related areas are
obsolete, etc. And now it will be much hard to get the same knowledge in
language Y quickly. You must be adequate to understand this.</p>

<p><strong>So, what does it mean from me:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Select minimal required set of
programming languages which makes you as productive as possible.
Master these languages</li>
<li>It’s a good idea to spend
time playing with other languages. But it’s bad idea to switch from
one to another language regularly. You are losing focus.</li>
<li>Master ecosystem</li>
<li>Be active in language
community</li>
</ul>


<p>I don’t want to say that learning new
languages is a bad idea. No. I don’t think so. But the reality has some
influence on us. It might happen that “new” language and related areas
are cool, you are happy using all these stuff working on pet-projects.
But you have some objective constrains and can’t use it at your work:
e.g. a) there are no projects where you can use this language or b) you
can’t change the company because of geographical constrains. Keeping all
these in mind you should spend your time effectively and learn
really valuable stuff. <br/>
