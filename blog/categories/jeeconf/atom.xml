    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/jeeconf.png"></p>

<p>It happened again - I attend <a href="http://jeeconf.com">JEEConf</a>, May 22-23, 2015. And as usual it was inspiring. Also, I can say that <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">&ldquo;Scala&rdquo;</a> was the most dominated buzz word at this conference.</p>

<p>So, I attended the next talks:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pragmatic Functional Refactoring with Java 8, by Richard Warburton</strong> Java 8 functional features were introduced here. And were shown how we can refactor OOP program in functional way. I can say it&rsquo;s still a new way of thinking for Java developers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Just what are you doing, HotSpot? by Gleb Smirnov</strong> - Gleb gave us several advices for understanding tricky HotSpot behavior and why we should read HotSpot sources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lessons from Implementing a Modern B2C System in Scala, by Yuriy Guts</strong> It was a case study talk about starting new project with Scala. The most interesting  was the issues appeared during project development, team&rsquo;s relationship with Scala, and Scala influences on non-Scala developers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spring Puzzlers, by Evgeny Borisov and Baruch Sadogursky</strong> - We can say that this topic is unique. At least I&rsquo;m not aware of similar talks on other Java conferences. Spring Puzzlers is a variation of classic Java puzzlers, but in Spring. It&rsquo;s really great collection of tricky Spring parts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>JVM Languages Q&amp;A Panel with Jacek Laskowski, Baruch Sadogursky, Dmytro Mantula, Alexander Podkhalyuzin, Tomer Gabel</strong> We can say that this panel was Groovy vs Scala. There are no other &ldquo;languages&rdquo; on this talk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Building an Enterprise-less online bank, Anton Keks</strong> - Anton doesn&rsquo;t love bloated Spring and likes simple and clean solution. He doesn&rsquo;t use Play Framework 2 on Scala because of slow compilation. Instead of this, he told us about his banking platform implemented on <em>Play 1.3</em> and <em>Java 8</em>, and all other items included in his stack.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Everything you wanted to know about writing async, high-concurrency HTTP applications in Java, but were afraid to ask, by Baruch Sadogursky</strong> - Baruch shared his experience about implementing asynchronous file downloader in Java.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scala Rock-Painting, by Dmytro Mantula</strong> - This talk was like Scala puzzlers and/or Scala tricky parts. Speaker also gave us several suggesting how we can learn Scala more effectively via practicing <em>code katas</em> and/or <a href="http://ankisrs.net">Anki</a> flesh cards. This talk highlighted the &ldquo;dark&rdquo; side of Scala. Really, recommend it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Groovy under Macroscope, by Sergei Egorov and Baruch Sadogursky</strong> - Sergei demoed us very hacky Groovy library <a href="https://github.com/bsideup/MacroGroovy">MacroGroovy</a>. It&rsquo;s nice to see true Groovy hacker and his creature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>About concurrency abstractions with Observable’s, Future’s, Akka (actors) in Scala, by Jacek Laskowski</strong> - Jacek did Scala concurrency overview talk and highlighted other non-Akka libraries. It&rsquo;s nice to know that there are other <em>&ldquo;good&rdquo;</em> way to do concurrency without Akka.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Node.js and Evented I/O Alternatives on the JVM, by Niko Köbler</strong> - I definitely heard about <a href="https://avatar-js.java.net">Avatar.js</a>, but Niko told us that <a href="http://blog.n-k.de/2015/01/is-oracles-avatar-dead.html">Avatar.js is dead</a> and  <a href="http://blog.n-k.de/2015/02/current-status-of-oracles-project-avatar.html">Oracle put development of Avatar on hold</a>, i.e. full stop. As alternative were mentioned two solutions: <strong><a href="http://dynjs.org">DynJS</a></strong> an ECMAScript runtime for the JVM and <strong><a href="http://nodyn.io/">Nodyn</a></strong> - Node.js compatible framework on JVM. It&rsquo;s very interesting to see what will happen with them. <em>Nodyn</em> has strong RedHat support. Let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;s much stronger than Avatar.js had from  Oracle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do we need JMS in 21st century? by Mikalai Alimenkou</strong> - The simple statements can be extracted from this talk: a) there are other non-JMS Message queues (MQs); b) we don&rsquo;t need bloated JMS for every tasks; c) use right MQ for right job</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="Summary"></a>
<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>JEEConf has dedicated JVM track: 50% of this track was occupied by Scala (7 talks). As for me this is the sign ;-) Scala bandwagon reached Ukraine.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Microservices</em> everywhere. If you are not doing <em>microservices</em> - you should :-)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Yes, JEEConf is simply the best. <a href="http://xpinjection.com/">XP Injection</a> did amazing work.</p>

<p><strong>Have fun, love Java!</strong></p>

    <updated>2014-05-25T23:41:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://halyph.com/2014/05/jeeconf-kiev-2014-report</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/jeeconf.png"></p>

<p>I attended the forth <a href="http://jeeconf.com">JEEConf</a>, May 23-24, 2014. The situation in my country (Ukraine) is difficult that’s why I was amazed to see so many foreign speakers. The organizers did really tremendous work.</p>

<p>This year I divided topics by the next directions:</p>

<a name="Spring"></a>
<h3>Spring</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Spring 4, Java EE 7 or Both? by Ivar Grimstad</em> &ndash; The main idea of the talk was to show similar and different parts of Spring 4 and Java EE 7. And have an ability easily identify when to use one or another. There are trade-offs and we should be aware of them.</li>
<li><em>Spring configuration: how to do it right (experience report), Mikalai Alimenkou</em> &ndash; Mikalai shared his experience related to Spring configs. Nice talk. I&rsquo;m going to borrow some ideas ;-)</li>
<li><em>Spring the Ripper, by Evgeny Borisov</em> &ndash; It was the most dynamic talk at this conference. The presenter shown Spring life-cycle internals in action. Well done. It should be seen by every Spring dev :-)</li>
</ul>


<a name="Frameworks"></a>
<h3>Frameworks</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Apache Lucene/Solr Internals, by Anatoliy Sokolenko</em> &ndash; I had no experience with these technologies. And it was really nice intro. Now I have some clue how it works.</li>
<li><em>Streamline your processes with jBPM 6, by Jiri Svitak</em> &ndash; It was an into talk into jBPM 6. I had small experience with competitor framework <a href="http://activiti.org/">Activiti</a>. It&rsquo;s always interesting to see the similar framework&rsquo;s features.</li>
</ul>


<a name="Java.JVM.Compiler"></a>
<h3>Java/JVM/Compiler</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Java8: Stream Style, by Sergey Kuksenko</em> &ndash; It was Java 8 Stream introduction. There were shown different stream features and approaches.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://shipilev.net/blog/2014/heapdump-is-a-lie/">What Heap Dumps Are Lying To You About, by Aleksey Shipilёv</a></em> &ndash; It&rsquo;s a very special talk related to Java &ldquo;internals&rdquo;. Actually, this talk was about Java object size calculation and what happens under the hood.</li>
<li><em>Reflection Madness, by Heinz Kabutz</em> &ndash; The presenter told us about Java reflection magic, when to use it and why it&rsquo;s dangerous.</li>
</ul>


<a name="Miscellaneous"></a>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Tooling of a Test-Driven Developer, by Paweł Lipiński</em> &ndash; There were highlighted two very interesting libraries for TDD on top of JUnit: <a href="http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/">AssertJ</a> and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/junitparams/">JUnitParams</a>.Very interesting libraries</li>
<li><em>Web Apps in LISP!? EWW!, by Anatoly Polinsky</em> &ndash; Here was shown different aspects of web development in Clojure for beginners. It&rsquo;s was real intro, but very interesting, especially when you&rsquo;d like to spread your mind into alternative JVM-related communities.</li>
</ul>


<p>It was very productive conference for me. I&rsquo;ve got new portion of inspiration, new knowledge and passion to ordinary things.</p>

<p>This year we had the second <a href="http://jeeconf.com/" target="_blank">JEEConf</a>. The amount of stages was increased from three to <strong>four </strong>stages.
<br />I was really impressed about conference program &ldquo;notebooks&rdquo; :-) it was well done. The amount of people was really huge more then 600. I think it&rsquo;s impressive number for the second conference.
<br />
<br />As usual I&rsquo;ve selected the most interest topics to watch/visit to:
<br />
<br /><strong>1. Play with Play! by Anton Naumov</strong>
<br />The presenter briefly has shown the Play Framework v.1.2.x features and discussed the pros&amp;cons. The most notably was that he stated the &ldquo;fails&rdquo; caused by this framework and how we can avoid similar stuff. The most loud message was &ldquo;use Spring/MVC, Hibernate and Maven&rdquo; if you are experienced with them :-). And try to use Play for prototype projects.
<br />
<br /><strong>2. Hibernate performance tuning by Sander Mak</strong>
<br />It&rsquo;s very interesting and pragmatic topic. Even more I can say this presentation was a bunch of receipts for Hibernate performance improvement. There were depicted very interesting nuances which will be definitely valuable in real life codding.I&rsquo;m looking forward for slides.
<br />
<br /><strong>3.&nbsp; Methodology of performance optimization by Alexey Shipilyov and Sergey Kuksenko</strong>
<br />It was the most low-level topic on this conference. Guys shown the different ways to perform the subject. They review and in pair-speech way very complicated issues in performance optimization from conceptual point of view. I can&rsquo;t say that I will be able to reuse everything from this speech, but it&rsquo;s great start point for me. They are very proficient presenters.
<br />
<br /><strong>4. Becoming a Professional Java Developer by Yakov Fain</strong>
<br />I must say &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; for this speech. It was cool. Yakov has highlighted the non-technical aspect of Professional (Java) Developer. Of course his advices and <span class="short_text" id="result_box" lang="en"><span class="hps">observation are based on own experience and might be biased for somebody. But it&rsquo;s honest and reasonable speech might open &ldquo;some&rdquo; boring minds. Also, Yakov recommended to read his free e-book &ldquo;Enterprise Software without the BS&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve already downloaded it and I&rsquo;m planning to read it in nearest weeks.&nbsp;</span></span>
<br />
<br /><strong><span class="short_text" id="result_box" lang="en"><span class="hps">5. Inject Injection by Yuriy Litvinenko</span></span></strong>
<br /><span class="short_text" id="result_box" lang="en"><span class="hps">It was like a case study report about involving DI Framework (in this case Google Guice) in legacy project. It was very interesting, because I believe it&rsquo;s challenging task. The presenter has highlighted the issues which his team faced </span></span><span class="short_text" id="result_box" lang="en"><span class="hps">with</span></span><span class="short_text" id="result_box" lang="en"><span class="hps">. I can say this experience might be valuable when somebody needs to decide the benefits and evaluate the risks of involving DI </span></span><span class="short_text" id="result_box" lang="en"><span class="hps">Framework in something &ldquo;really old</span></span><span class="short_text" id="result_box" lang="en"><span class="hps"></span></span>&rdquo;. Well done.
<br />
<br /><strong>6. Cloud Java platforms: what&rsquo;s inside and what&rsquo;s the difference by Ruslan Synytskyy</strong>
<br />It was a pleasure to see ukrainian who is one of the founders of <a href="http://jelastic.com/">Jelastic</a>. Ruslan has reviewed&nbsp; different types of&nbsp; &ldquo;* as a Service&rdquo;: SaaS, PaaS and IaaS. The comparison criteria of PaaS&rsquo;s are very useful for further evaluation.
<br />
<br /><strong>7. Why do I hate the Hibernate? by Mikalai Alimenkou</strong>
<br />It was pragmatic, based on real experience presentation with tons of Hibernate issues. It&rsquo;s very useful for anyone who&rsquo;s developing application with Hibernate. We must know the weaknesses of our tools. Mikalai has used very interesting approach to blame something/someone: &ldquo;nasty granny&rdquo;. You should review the slides to this presentation to understand what does it mean.
<br />
<br />I&rsquo;d like to say <i>&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo;</i> JEEConf organizers team. You are doing very important work for Ukrainian Java Community.

    <updated>2011-05-24T00:41:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://halyph.com/blog/2011/05/24/jeeconf-kiev-2011-report</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had a chance to attend the first and totally dedicated to <a href="http://jeeconf.com/">Java conference in Kiev</a> (May 21, 2011).
<br />It was a great. The atmosphere was amazing. The organization was good, really good. The most noticeable thing was that almost every presentation was based on real problem, no metaphysical stuff :-)
<br />There were three stages, that&rsquo;s why I couldn&rsquo;t attend every talk and that&rsquo;s a pity.
<br />
<br />Here is a short overview of all attended talks:
<br />
<br /><strong>1. &ldquo;What Riding the <a href="http://camel.apache.org/">Camel </a>can do to make integration easier for you&rdquo; by Claus Ibsen.</strong>
<br />I had an idea what the Camel is, but this presentation gave me the &ldquo;big picture&rdquo;. Actually, the speaker has been well prepared and known the presentation technique very well. He showed all major aspects of Camel framework and explain its purpose.
<br />
<br />He&rsquo;s shown the several Camel&rsquo;s DSLs: XML-based, Java and Scala. That short code snippets were really cool and clean. So, I&rsquo;ve added into my todo list &ldquo;the Camel DSL digging&rdquo; ;-)
<br />
<br /><strong>2. &ldquo;The <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala </a>and <a href="http://www.gridgain.com/">GridGain </a>usage for the distributed systems with high efficiency&rdquo; by Renat Ahmerov.</strong>
<br />This talk and master-class inspired me to start Scala learning. I&rsquo;ve never seen the cloud computing in action. But during that master-class was created real application for distributed computing. And the code base was so tiny and clean, so my heart falling in love to this language. The last time I had had the similar feeling when I&rsquo;ve seen the Rails in action.
<br />
<br /><strong>3. The problem diagnosing and GC tuning in HotSpot Java VM by Vladimir Ivanov.</strong>
<br />This talk was like a JVM magic :-). The speaker discovered the darkest GC places I&rsquo;ve never known about. He&rsquo;s opened my eyes. I even couldn&rsquo;t expect that GC tuning is so interesting.
<br />
<br /><strong>4. To be in ten times faster kudos <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy </a>by Evgeny Kompaniec</strong>
<br />This guy has shown the real case study:
<br />- Why he choose the Groovy as Java substitution.
<br />- Java code snippets vs Groovy (functionally equal) code snippets. IMHO, the most interesting and inspiration part of talk.
<br />- Groovy knowledge sharing via pros &amp; cons.
<br />
<br />5. <strong><a href="http://www.unitils.org/">Unitils </a>for Java testing by Mikalai Alimenkou</strong>
<br />To be honest I&rsquo;ve never heard about this tools. This presentation was full of practical samples and advices like a cookbook. Great talk, the presenter had a good mood and used the right jokes in the right places, he was very impressive. I wish every speaker had such good presentation technique.
<br />
<br /><strong>6. How Graph Databases can make you a super star by Andrés Taylor</strong>
<br />This talk was dedicated to the &ldquo;beauty&rdquo; of <a href="http://neo4j.org/">Neo4j</a> graph DB. It was just a start point for this DB.
<br />
<br /><strong>7. <a href="http://vaadin.com/">Vaadin</a>, Rich Web Apps in Server-Side Java without Plug-ins or JavaScript by Joonas Lehtinen</strong>
<br />I&rsquo;ve been following this framework about a year. And I must admit that it was really impressed to see CEO of company behind Vaadin.
<br />The talk was short and pragmatic. The major areas of Vaadin were highlighted. Then, the presenter has shown the Vaadin in action and it was cool. The community and the whole framework evolved in one year. As for me it was great to see the real person who developed so interesting stuff.
<br />
<br />It was my 6th IT conference. I must admit it was the best, no doubts. I hope to attend the Java conference next year again.</p>
