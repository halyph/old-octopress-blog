<p>This summer I&rsquo;ve decided to attend my 1<sup>st</sup> foreign conference - <a href="http://devoxx.pl">DevoxxPL - Krakow, Poland, 22-25 June 2015</a>. It was very important experience, because I wanted to compare it with our local Ukrainian conferences. Long story short - the quality is equal. Any conference is based on speakers (I&rsquo;d like to be &ldquo;Captain Obvious&rdquo;). And even awesome conference location can&rsquo;t make conference <strong>great</strong>.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;ve attended the next talks:</p>

    <link href="http://halyph.com/blog/2015/05/25/jeeconf-kiev/"/>
    <updated>2015-05-25T00:45:51+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://halyph.com/blog/2015/05/25/jeeconf-kiev</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/jeeconf.png"></p>

<p>It happened again - I attend <a href="http://jeeconf.com">JEEConf</a>, May 22-23, 2015. And as usual it was inspiring. Also, I can say that <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">&ldquo;Scala&rdquo;</a> was the most dominated buzz word at this conference.</p>

<p>So, I attended the next talks:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pragmatic Functional Refactoring with Java 8, by Richard Warburton</strong> Java 8 functional features were introduced here. And were shown how we can refactor OOP program in functional way. I can say it&rsquo;s still a new way of thinking for Java developers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Just what are you doing, HotSpot? by Gleb Smirnov</strong> - Gleb gave us several advices for understanding tricky HotSpot behavior and why we should read HotSpot sources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lessons from Implementing a Modern B2C System in Scala, by Yuriy Guts</strong> It was a case study talk about starting new project with Scala. The most interesting  was the issues appeared during project development, team&rsquo;s relationship with Scala, and Scala influences on non-Scala developers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spring Puzzlers, by Evgeny Borisov and Baruch Sadogursky</strong> - We can say that this topic is unique. At least I&rsquo;m not aware of similar talks on other Java conferences. Spring Puzzlers is a variation of classic Java puzzlers, but in Spring. It&rsquo;s really great collection of tricky Spring parts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>JVM Languages Q&amp;A Panel with Jacek Laskowski, Baruch Sadogursky, Dmytro Mantula, Alexander Podkhalyuzin, Tomer Gabel</strong> We can say that this panel was Groovy vs Scala. There are no other &ldquo;languages&rdquo; on this talk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Building an Enterprise-less online bank, Anton Keks</strong> - Anton doesn&rsquo;t love bloated Spring and likes simple and clean solution. He doesn&rsquo;t use Play Framework 2 on Scala because of slow compilation. Instead of this, he told us about his banking platform implemented on <em>Play 1.3</em> and <em>Java 8</em>, and all other items included in his stack.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Everything you wanted to know about writing async, high-concurrency HTTP applications in Java, but were afraid to ask, by Baruch Sadogursky</strong> - Baruch shared his experience about implementing asynchronous file downloader in Java.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scala Rock-Painting, by Dmytro Mantula</strong> - This talk was like Scala puzzlers and/or Scala tricky parts. Speaker also gave us several suggesting how we can learn Scala more effectively via practicing <em>code katas</em> and/or <a href="http://ankisrs.net">Anki</a> flesh cards. This talk highlighted the &ldquo;dark&rdquo; side of Scala. Really, recommend it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Groovy under Macroscope, by Sergei Egorov and Baruch Sadogursky</strong> - Sergei demoed us very hacky Groovy library <a href="https://github.com/bsideup/MacroGroovy">MacroGroovy</a>. It&rsquo;s nice to see true Groovy hacker and his creature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>About concurrency abstractions with Observable’s, Future’s, Akka (actors) in Scala, by Jacek Laskowski</strong> - Jacek did Scala concurrency overview talk and highlighted other non-Akka libraries. It&rsquo;s nice to know that there are other <em>&ldquo;good&rdquo;</em> way to do concurrency without Akka.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Node.js and Evented I/O Alternatives on the JVM, by Niko Köbler</strong> - I definitely heard about <a href="https://avatar-js.java.net">Avatar.js</a>, but Niko told us that <a href="http://blog.n-k.de/2015/01/is-oracles-avatar-dead.html">Avatar.js is dead</a> and  <a href="http://blog.n-k.de/2015/02/current-status-of-oracles-project-avatar.html">Oracle put development of Avatar on hold</a>, i.e. full stop. As alternative were mentioned two solutions: <strong><a href="http://dynjs.org">DynJS</a></strong> an ECMAScript runtime for the JVM and <strong><a href="http://nodyn.io/">Nodyn</a></strong> - Node.js compatible framework on JVM. It&rsquo;s very interesting to see what will happen with them. <em>Nodyn</em> has strong RedHat support. Let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;s much stronger than Avatar.js had from  Oracle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do we need JMS in 21st century? by Mikalai Alimenkou</strong> - The simple statements can be extracted from this talk: a) there are other non-JMS Message queues (MQs); b) we don&rsquo;t need bloated JMS for every tasks; c) use right MQ for right job</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="Summary"></a>
<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>JEEConf has dedicated JVM track: 50% of this track was occupied by Scala (7 talks). As for me this is the sign ;-) Scala bandwagon reached Ukraine.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Microservices</em> everywhere. If you are not doing <em>microservices</em> - you should :-)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Yes, JEEConf is simply the best. <a href="http://xpinjection.com/">XP Injection</a> did amazing work.</p>

<p><strong>Have fun, love Java!</strong></p>

    <updated>2014-05-25T23:41:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://halyph.com/2014/05/jeeconf-kiev-2014-report</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/images/blog/jeeconf.png"></p>

<p>I attended the forth <a href="http://jeeconf.com">JEEConf</a>, May 23-24, 2014. The situation in my country (Ukraine) is difficult that’s why I was amazed to see so many foreign speakers. The organizers did really tremendous work.</p>

<p>This year I divided topics by the next directions:</p>

<a name="Spring"></a>
<h3>Spring</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Spring 4, Java EE 7 or Both? by Ivar Grimstad</em> &ndash; The main idea of the talk was to show similar and different parts of Spring 4 and Java EE 7. And have an ability easily identify when to use one or another. There are trade-offs and we should be aware of them.</li>
<li><em>Spring configuration: how to do it right (experience report), Mikalai Alimenkou</em> &ndash; Mikalai shared his experience related to Spring configs. Nice talk. I&rsquo;m going to borrow some ideas ;-)</li>
<li><em>Spring the Ripper, by Evgeny Borisov</em> &ndash; It was the most dynamic talk at this conference. The presenter shown Spring life-cycle internals in action. Well done. It should be seen by every Spring dev :-)</li>
</ul>


<a name="Frameworks"></a>
<h3>Frameworks</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Apache Lucene/Solr Internals, by Anatoliy Sokolenko</em> &ndash; I had no experience with these technologies. And it was really nice intro. Now I have some clue how it works.</li>
<li><em>Streamline your processes with jBPM 6, by Jiri Svitak</em> &ndash; It was an into talk into jBPM 6. I had small experience with competitor framework <a href="http://activiti.org/">Activiti</a>. It&rsquo;s always interesting to see the similar framework&rsquo;s features.</li>
</ul>


<a name="Java.JVM.Compiler"></a>
<h3>Java/JVM/Compiler</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Java8: Stream Style, by Sergey Kuksenko</em> &ndash; It was Java 8 Stream introduction. There were shown different stream features and approaches.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://shipilev.net/blog/2014/heapdump-is-a-lie/">What Heap Dumps Are Lying To You About, by Aleksey Shipilёv</a></em> &ndash; It&rsquo;s a very special talk related to Java &ldquo;internals&rdquo;. Actually, this talk was about Java object size calculation and what happens under the hood.</li>
<li><em>Reflection Madness, by Heinz Kabutz</em> &ndash; The presenter told us about Java reflection magic, when to use it and why it&rsquo;s dangerous.</li>
</ul>


<a name="Miscellaneous"></a>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Tooling of a Test-Driven Developer, by Paweł Lipiński</em> &ndash; There were highlighted two very interesting libraries for TDD on top of JUnit: <a href="http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/">AssertJ</a> and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/junitparams/">JUnitParams</a>.Very interesting libraries</li>
<li><em>Web Apps in LISP!? EWW!, by Anatoly Polinsky</em> &ndash; Here was shown different aspects of web development in Clojure for beginners. It&rsquo;s was real intro, but very interesting, especially when you&rsquo;d like to spread your mind into alternative JVM-related communities.</li>
</ul>


<p>It was very productive conference for me. I&rsquo;ve got new portion of inspiration, new knowledge and passion to ordinary things.</p>

<div>Kiev, 16-17 November, two days conference related to agile engeneering practices. I was there and it was cool. The organisers did really good job especially when selected those amazing speakers. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>


<div>Here is the core ideas extracted from this conference:</div>


<div><ul><li>The role of software architecture in agile project (&#8220;The frustrated architect&#8221;, by Simon Brown). How, when and why involve software design and why does it meter. Avoid dogmatism in agile projects.</li><li>Testing, TDD, continuos integration (CI), continuos deployment and quick builds are keys for success in agile projects:</li><li style="list-style: none;">  <ul><li>&#8220;Testability for developers: Fighting a mess by making it testable&#8221;, by Alexander Tarnowski</li><li>&#8220;Our way from 90 to 6500 tests&#8221;, by Ivan Medvedev</li><li>&#8220;Crazy Talk: When 10 second builds start to make you nervous&#8221;, by Daniel Worthington-Bodart</li><li>&#8220;Psychology of testing&#8221;, by&nbsp;Miško Hevery (USA)</li></ul></li><li>After these talk&nbsp;&#8220;Agile Testing by Example&#8221;, by Mikalai Alimenkou and Andrii Dzynia I am a bit confused. Because speakers showed us how QA engineer should work with developers in agile team. It opened my eyes on monkey QAs I&#8217;ve seen so far. I have to motivate my colleagues to evolve their skills. No monkey job, only intellectual testing, proper tools for better work performance which simplify communication between developers and testers (QAs).</li><li>Several presenters showed their ways of using awersome tools:&nbsp;</li><li style="list-style: none;">  <ul><li>Acceptance testing of Web UI components via WebDeiver, Thucydides and Groovy , be Vladimir Tsukur</li></ul><ul><li>&#8220;Behavior-Driven Development on the JVM: A State of the Union&#8221;, by John Smart. Here was highlighted the next tools: Selenium, JBehave, Spock, Cucumber and Thucydides. Which one use for each tests (unit, acceptance, UI, etc.)</li></ul><ul><li>&#8220;How Testacular makes AngularJS super-heroic at testing&#8221;, by Miško Hevery. The creator of AngularJS showed demo how easy is to test AngularJS based app. It was really cool and inspired me to look closer into this framework.</li><li>&#8220;Introducing Thucydides: Better Automated Acceptance Testing on the JVM&#8221;, by John Smart. The creator of Thucydides presented the concept behind this tool, how cool it is and when to use it.<span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; color: black; display: inline !important; float: none; font-family: Arial; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;</span></li><li>&#8220;Continuous Inspection with Sonar&#8221;, by Olivier Gaudin.&nbsp;CEO of SonarSource presented the main idea of continuos code inspection. He highlighted that it&#8217;s just a tool and we should use it as a part of overall development process to make it really valuable. It sounds reasonable, but so many people use Sonar metrics without deep understanding of what problems stand behind these numbers.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>&#8220;Agile Anti-Patterns. Yes your agile projects can and will fail too&#8221;, by Sander Hoogendoorn. This speech was really inspiring, very honest and sarcastic. The speaker said about crazy dogmas in Agile. It&#8217;s a funny to see how many people in our industry trying to copy some development process without simply adjustment to own project(s) and team(s). And Sander loudly told us about all this crap. I like his critics about Scrum &#8220;Masters&#8221; which are certified after 2-days training and accepted as Scrum experts without a single year experience in real Agile project. I&#8217;ve been waiting on video record of this talk. I can&#8217;t wait to show it to some agile &#8220;experts&#8221;.<span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; color: black; display: inline !important; float: none; font-family: Arial; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</li></ul><div>This conference gives additional motivation to push &#8220;right&#8221; practices in my&nbsp;surroundings. It&#8217;s amazing how positively motivated conference can be. Unfortunately, many developers are very passive and don&#8217;t &nbsp;want to spend their time and money for education. They simply know &#8220;everything&#8221; they need.</div></div>
