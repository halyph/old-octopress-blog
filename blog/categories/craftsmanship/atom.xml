<p>I&rsquo;ve read this book the third time. Authors (Venkat Subramaniam and Andy Hunt) shared their ideas and better practices regarding &ldquo;how to become a real agile developer&rdquo;.<br />Each chapter has predefined structure:<br /><ol><li>General idea</li><li>Why something went wrong </li><li>Applying the practice</li><li>What might go wrong if we try to follow the practice without common sense</li><li>Summary</li></ol>I can suggest this book for any developer who has been diving in the world of &ldquo;agile&rdquo;. Even more, any junior developer must read this book. After the reading and applying some of the recipes you&rsquo;ve got real improvements in your daily work. Do not hesitate and start reading right away.</p>

<p><br />This book has <i>wow </i>effect for me. The author is famous <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin" target="_blank">@unclebobmartin</a>. I called books of such type as <b><i>&ldquo;craftsmanship</i></b>&rdquo; books (term borrowed from <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin" target="_blank">@unclebobmartin</a>). This book is like a companion book for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/ref=pd_sim_b_3">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>, but it has a little bit another &ldquo;inflection&rdquo;:
<br /></p>

<ol>
    <li>Book has close relation to software engineering as a profession and style is narrative. It very easy to read and follow the general idea.</li>
    <li>Uncle Bob did very important thing (as for me), he told us about his own failures and their consequences. It is looks very honest which brings together author and reader.</li>
    <li>He isn&#8217;t cardinal in his statements. Be pragmatic, borrow his experience and just don&#8217;t do the same mistakes.</li>
    <li>You won&#8217;t find any technological advices in this book. There is ONLY life concepts :)</li>
    <li>It&#8217;s like a craftsmanship Zen for software engineers.</li>
    <li>Uncle Bob gives us bootstrap cookbook for non-technological skills.</li>
</ol>


<p>&nbsp;Read it. Re-think the ideas. And improve your skills.
<br /></p>
